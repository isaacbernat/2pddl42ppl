2 paddles for (up to) 2 people to play on a single console.

Proof of concept implementation in [Thumby](https://thumby.us/) which uses familiar Pong mechanics. Has Versus, Coop and Solo modes. Physics, paddle, balls and up to 8 parameters are easily adjusted using the game settings menu. All this well under 0x100 (255) lines of code.

Do you think [Thumby](https://thumby.us/) is too small to be played by an adult. Well, here is proof it can be played by 2 at the same time with a single device! Notice that the ball gets smaller (and faster) on each bounce to keep it challenging (and one may configure this among other params).

## How to play?
- Player 1 controls a paddle using up and down arrow from D-pad (as expected).
- Player 2 controls the other paddle using A and B buttons, the top-most to move the paddle up, the other down.
- The goal is to keep the ball bouncing on the paddles for as long as possible.
- You can try it on a [Thumby emulator here](https://code.thumby.us/)
