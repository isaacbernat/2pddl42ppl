2 paddles for (up to) 2 people to play on a single console.

Proof of concept implementation in [Thumby](https://thumby.us/) which uses familiar Pong mechanics. Has Versus, Coop and Solo modes. Physics, paddle, balls and up to 8 parameters are easily adjusted using the game settings menu. All this well under 0x100 (255) lines of code.

Do you think [Thumby](https://thumby.us/) is too small to be played by an adult. Well, here is proof it can be played by 2 people at the same time with a single device! Notice that the ball gets smaller on each bounce to keep it challenging (and one may configure this among other params).
